This project was developed as part of the Operating Systems course of the Telecommunications and Computer Engineering bachelor degree at Iscte-iul.
This was a 3 part project:
In the first part, I developed a system for booking medical appointments in shell script.
In part 2, I developed a simplified model for patient triage and appointments in C, using Linux Processes and Signals and a client/server architecture.
In part 3, I developed the same system but used Linux inter-process communication (IPCS) instead.
